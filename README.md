#ArcadeGame

Welcome to the ArcadeGame repository! This project is a collection of classic arcade-style games implemented in Python.
Here, you will find several games, including memory puzzles, slide puzzles, a Tetris clone ("tetromino"), and "wormy" (a variation of the classic Snake game).
Explore the arcade, play games, and collect points.
